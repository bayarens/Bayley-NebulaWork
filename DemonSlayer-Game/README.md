## to-do:
give attacks special atributes 
add defend function 
create shop 
create money counter 
create kill counter 
create start screen/ character select screen 
create other 2 characters 
create demon character sprite
make game over screen 
make health bars turn red for missing health/ also reset them after start game function
I know the play animation function keeps playing over on top of itself and messes up the idle animation, fix that 
make it so that if you fail to run away demon attack plays out 
^ same for defend
define close with function-b/c there is no gameover option 
Enemy's damage ranges arent working
