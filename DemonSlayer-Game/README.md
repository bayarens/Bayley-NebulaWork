## to-do:
give attacks special atributes 
create money counter  
create start screen/ character select screen 
create other 2 characters 
create demon character sprite
make game over screen 
make health bars turn red for missing health
I know the play animation function keeps playing over on top of itself and messes up the idle animation, fix that 
^ same for defend
define close with function-b/c there is no gameover option- also add implent the min health value so dead characters stay at 0
