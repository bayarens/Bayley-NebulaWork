        The Cottage Garden
    </h1>
    <p>
        The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamelntal and edible plants.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <u>estate gardens</u>.

        The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern desendants, with an emphasis on vegtables and herbs, aling with some fruit trees.
